# tring_js

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
node index.js
```

I personally use `just run` or `make run`. For cleaning the mess, use `just clean && just clean_sql`. (just clean_sql will remove all the tables and types from your database, so it's destructive)

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.38. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
